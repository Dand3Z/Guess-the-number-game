# Guess-the-number-game
A simple "Guess the number game" made with the Spring Framework

The project consists of three modules:
- console -> Allows you to launch the game in the console. Just run the main method from the Main class.
- core -> The logic behind the game
- web -> Web layer of the application. Run the main method in the WebMain class, then go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. 

The web version of the game supports 3 language versions:
- English (en)
- German (de)
- Spanish (es)

For example, if you are at http://localhost:8080/, add ?lang=de to the link getting http://localhost:8080/?lang=de and execute this.
The game is now in German
